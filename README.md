# Purpose

Purpose is to test the ability to create draw.io diagrams with Gemini after first tinkering with the look of the diagram in gemini.

# Test 1 Diagram from Doc Content
Had gemini create an infographic of the control plane access method for GKE based on the documentation link [https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/network-isolation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/network-isolation)

It generated the following infographic:

```
Can you generate an infographic explaining the concepts of control plane access methods covered here https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/network-isolation
```

Asked Gemini to produce an xml version of the diagram to open in draw.io.

After Gemini produced the xml for import to draw.io, the diagram opened properly:

# Test 2: From Infographic as input

The image is fed as the input. Altho it was generated by Gemini, it was done on a different chat and here we are just feeding gemini an image.

We will see if Gemini 3 can create an xml for this diagram (also generated by nano banana)

will have to tinker with that one....


# Test 3: Regenerate Existing Image & generate .xml

Now what if you wanted to expand upon an already existing architectural diagram that you unfortunately did not create yourself.

Have gemini recreate the image, maybe it will then be able to generate the draw.io xml :

Not 100% but good starting point...
